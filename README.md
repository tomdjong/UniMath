The Scott Model of PCF in Univalent Type Theory
============================================================

This is the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) formalisation of the constructive Scott model of PCF.
It uses the [UniMath](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath) library.
It includes a copy of the UniMath library for compatibility and to make it easy to run without too much setting up.

The paper accompanying this formalisation can be found
[here](https://github.com/tomdjong/UniMath/blob/paper/paper.pdf).

Installation
------------

For general instructions, see 
[INSTALL.md](https://github.com/tomdjong/UniMath/blob/paper/INSTALL.md).

Use 
```bash
$ make Partiality
```
in the root directory to make the PCF formalisation

Use
```bash
$ make doc
```
in the root directory to create HTML documentation that allow for easy reading
of the code. Find the documentation at enhanced-html/index.html.
